Although the signalling pathway exhibits a transient response to changes in signal strength, 
its steady-state response R is independent of S. Such behaviour is typical of chemotactic systems, 
which respond to an abrupt change in attractants or repellents, but then adapt to a constant level of the signal. 
The human sense of smell operates the same way. Below is SBGN brick that provides visualisation of this motif. 
The VCell model <a href="/modelbricks/Tyson_2003_1d.vcml">Tyson_2003_1c.vcml</a> provides an executable counterpart 
for this multiplex brick.
